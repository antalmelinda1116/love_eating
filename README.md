## **Goal for this project**

*"You are what you eat"* You can hear it often, and it is true. Health and gastronomy are gettig to be more important and famous day by day. Many people enjoy cooking but it is hard to have new ideaas and not to cook the same, well learnt recipes after a while. To avoid getting bored of cooking I created *Love Eating* webpage where you can search for new recipes, get inspired by other people and share your unique ideas also! 
This is a real community of unrecognized chefs (yet).
